What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	.git folder is created with metadata for version history. Without that, it's 
	just a folder, not a respository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	
	Staging area is a notation from git, but not part of the repository. It 
	provides the capacity to commit multiple, but not all files in one commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	Even with multiple files with uncommitted changes, the staging area can be 
	used to stage and commit one or some files at a time. You can also 
	'diff --staged' to check that the changes about to be committed are exactly 
	what you expect.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	Experimenting/refactoring. Branches can be optional sorts of changes that don't 
	necessarily belong in the master branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
